    <p>I love working on different projects related to my major, including <strong>learning programming languages, creating new programs, working on myself and improving my skills</strong>. I have experience mainly in <span style="color:red">C, C++, C#, Java and Python</span> programming languages.
        In order to specialize in this field, I am specifically leaning towards the <b><u><i>Java</i></u></b> programming language. In addition, increasing personal development is another priority for me, because the motivation of employees, the proper use of communication skills
        I believe it is very important for companies to do, demonstrate leadership skills and increase team spirit. Therefore, I develop my personal development skills in the areas of leadership, philosophy, sociology, psychology and civilization.</p>
